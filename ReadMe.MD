Good day and welcome to the Zillow Dataset and exploration process.

As a Code up Data science student and graduate, I will be using some data exploration and data testing skills that I have learned in the Data science pipeline so that I can show my expertise in the hopes of getting the opportunity to interview with Zillow.

This project:
    - End-to-end 
    - use kraggle data to predict property values 
    - predict single unit prices using 2017 observations 
    
we will start by aquiring  and using the Zillow Dataset courtesy of the folks at CodeUp.
